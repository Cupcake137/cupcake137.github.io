## 📜 Overview
Simula-o_Ataque_PTES_Windows is a simulation for penetration testing on Windows systems. It aligns with the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and uses only built-in Windows tools like CMD and PowerShell. This project shows a realistic approach to security testing by simulating attacks that a Windows system might face in the real world.

## 📚 Description
This project details a complete pentesting simulation using only native Windows tools. No third-party applications are required, which makes it easy to set up and use. The main goal of this simulation is to educate users about pentesting methodologies through practical exercises. The attacks focus on using LOLBins (Living Off the Land Binaries) to demonstrate how Windows can be exploited by other Windows systems.
